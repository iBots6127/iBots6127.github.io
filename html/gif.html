<center><p class - murmurationdescription> The iBots teamed up with SLSRA to host and operate a booth in the Murmuration Festival 
        in St. Louis to inform the public about robotics and FIRST. People who passed by had the opportunity to learn about programs 
        in which to enroll themselves or their children and even got to try their hand at building a robot from the TETRIX kit.

        <center> <p class = mrhsdescription> The principal of Maplewood Richmond Heights High School, a high school in 
                Maplewood, Missouri, expressed his interest in establishing a robotics team at his school. Shruti and two 
                mentors met with him to present about the FIRST program and basic guidelines for starting a team, as well 
                as to answer his questions on the workings of robotics. The school is currently working on getting the program 
                approved by its school board. </p>

                <center>< p class = hostingmeetdescription> Due to a great increase in the robotics-team density in St. Louis, 
                        FIRST in St.Louis adopted a new structure of tournaments, involving smaller competitive events (meets) 
                        that teams host and participate in independently. The iBots worked with the CyberDucks to host and run a 
                        meet in St. Louis Community College where twelve local teams competed. </p>
